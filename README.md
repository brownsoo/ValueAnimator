## Usage

ValueAnimator makes the transition from initial value to target value using easing functions.

#### Simple animation

```swift
let animator = ValueAnimator.animate("some", from: 0, to: 360, duration: 1.0,
    onChanged: { p, v in 
        print("property \(p): \(v.value)")
    },
    easing: EaseCircular.easeIn())
animator.resume()
```

#### Yoyo annimation with 2 values

```swift
let yoyoAni = ValueAnimator.animate(
    props: ["h", "w"], 
    from: [20, 30], 
    to: [5, 150], 
    duration: 1.4, 
    easing: EaseSine.easeInOut(), 
    onChanged: { p, v in
        if p == "h" {
            let width = self.rect1.bounds.width
            self.rect1.frame = CGRect(x: 24, y: 140, width: width, height:v.cg)
        } else {
            let height = self.rect1.bounds.height
            self.rect1.frame = CGRect(x: 24, y: 140, width:v.cg, height: height)
        }
    }, 
    option: ValueAnimator.OptionBuilder()
        .setYoyo(true)
        .build())
yoyoAni.resume()
```


#### Thread

ValueAnimator uses its own work-thread. But the callback `changeCallback`, `endCallback` is called in main-thread. if you wanna it called in work-thread, you just set the 'callbackOnMainThread' property is false.

```swift
let someView: UIView!
let animator = ValueAnimator.animate("some", from: 0, to: 1, duration: 1.0,
    onChanged: { p, v in 
        // called in ValueAnimator's work-thread
    },
    easing: EaseCircular.easeIn())
animator.callbackOnMainThread = false
animator.resume()
```
